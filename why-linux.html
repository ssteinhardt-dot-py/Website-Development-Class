        <h1>Why Should I choose Linux?</h1>
        <p>
            Linux is a free and open source operating system.It is designed
            in a way that promotes security, choice, and no overtly intrusive
            data collection practices. These days it is very easy to install
            and get off the ground while not bloating up your computer with
            unnecessary bloatware. And thanks to recent technologies created
            by Valve, such as proton, it is even a good platform for gaming now.
            Below is an example of a linux desktop environment designed to be 
            familiar to Microsoft Windows users.
