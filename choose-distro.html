    <h1>Choosing a Linux Distro</h1>
    <h2>Keeping things simple</h2>
    <p>
        One of the biggest hurdles newcomers to linux run in to is when they go to research
        linux, they are bombarded with literally thousands of different options on linux distros
        they can install. In the following sections, I aim to keep things simple by providing a 
        few options that I think would be a good starting point for a beginner.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Elementary-os</li>
        <li>Linux Mint</li>
        <li>Ubuntu</li>
        <li>Pop!_Os</li>
        <li>Fedora</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Side note: the only real big difference between linux distros usually comes down 
        to what desktop environment they use, and what software they have pre-installed. 
        But looking at things from a newcomers perspective, giving them a distro gives them
        an option that is as close to plug and play as it gets when installing alternative
        opertating systems.
